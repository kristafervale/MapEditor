# MapEditor
2D map using Voronoi Diagrams as a start.
This project was the item I was working on when Yogventures came to an ubrupt end.
The goal of the project was to create an addon to Yogventures that would allow players to generate their own landscapes.
Yogventures was, at it heart, a game about allowing players to build their own adventures. The engine was largely a proceduraly generated voxel engine. The major downside to that, is that by and large players couldn't predict what kind of world they would recieve when they started a new adventure. This is fine if you are building a game about exploration, but this was supposed to be about player created adventures that they could share with their friends.

This Map Editor would have been the first step to help players create maps quickly and easily for their adventures. It uses some clever map generation tricks inspired by http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/

This was an unfinished project that I would someday like to revisit.

I'm uploading it here as an example of code I wrote while working on Yogventures as I'm unable to share the rest of it for three reasons. 1. I signed a contract with the Yogscast LTD stating that I wouldn't share it.
2. The actual game code is so old now it doesn't actually run because I abandonded it so long ago I no longer have an actual working version.
3. It would take far too much time to get it back into working order.
